## 📚 Books ##
Reading is an important part of my life, or rather, it breathes more lives into this one. I like how Harold Bloom talked about reading in *How to Read and Why*, saying that reading well is one of the great pleasures that solitude can offer, through returning oneself to otherness and as such alleviating loneliness. 

Here are some of my favourite books:

### Novels
- *红楼梦* by 曹雪芹
- *The Master and Margarita* by Михаил Афанасьевич Булгаков
- *Invisible Cities* by Italo Calvino
- *As I Lay Dying* by William Faulkner
- *The Castle* by Franz Kafka

### Short Stories
- *South Highway* by Julio Cortázar
- *Hills Like White Elephants* by Ernest Hemingway
- *地獄変* by 芥川 龍之介

## ⚽ Sports ##

I have always loved playing soccer, but sadly, I got seriously injuired in an intramural game in the summer of 2024. Hopefully I will be able to play again soon. Besides, I am a big Liverpool fan.
