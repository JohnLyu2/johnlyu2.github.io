Hi, this is John Lü (吕正旸 in Chinese). Welcome to my personal website!

I am a 2nd-year PhD student at the University of Waterloo. My supervisors are Prof. [Vijay Ganesh](https://vganesh1.github.io/) and Prof. [Arie Gurfinkel](https://arieg.bitbucket.io/). I am also collarbating with Prof. [Florin Manea](https://flmanea.blogspot.com/)'s group at the Universty of Göttingen and Prof. [Dirk Beyer](https://www.sosy-lab.org/)'s group at LMU Munich.

My strongest research interest is to combine reasoning and learning. Below are some of my current and past research projects: 

- Algorithm Selection and Strategy Synthesis for SMT
- [Algorithm Selection for Verification](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/FGmF8gS3)
- [String Constraint Solving](https://z3string.github.io/)
- Machine Learning for SAT heuristics
