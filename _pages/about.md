Hi, this is John Lü (吕正旸 in Chinese). Welcome to my person website!

I am a 2nd-year PhD student at the University of Waterloo, Canada, under the supervison of Prof. [Vijay Ganesh](https://vganesh1.github.io/) and Prof. [Arie Gurfinkel](https://arieg.bitbucket.io/). I also have a long-time collaration with Prof. [Florin Manea](https://flmanea.blogspot.com/)'s research group at the Universty of Göttingen since 2021.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and formal methods. Some projects that I am currently working on include:

- Algorithm Selection and Strategy Synthesis for SMT
- [Algorithm Selection for Verification](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/FGmF8gS3)
- [String Constraint Solving](https://z3string.github.io/)
- Machine Learning for SAT heuristics

News
======
- **Jul 2024** Our solver [Z3-alpha](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/0211.pdf) won multiple awards at [SMT-COMP 2024 (Single Query Track)](https://smt-comp.github.io/2024/results/results-single-query/)!  It achieved first place in QF_NonLinearIntArith and QF_NonLinearRealArith and had the best UNSAT-performance in QF_Datatypes and the best SAT-performance in QF_LinearIntArith. 
- **Jul 2024** I will serve as the Co-Chair of the [ECE Gradudate Student Association (ECEGSA)](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering-graduate-student-association/) for the upcoming year. I’m excited to contribute to the community and help foster a supportive environment for fellow graduate students.
