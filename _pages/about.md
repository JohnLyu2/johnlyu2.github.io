Hi, this is John Lü (吕正旸 in Chinese). Welcome to my personal website!

I am a 2nd-year PhD student at the University of Waterloo. My supervisors are Prof. [Vijay Ganesh](https://vganesh1.github.io/) and Prof. [Arie Gurfinkel](https://arieg.bitbucket.io/). I am also collarbating with Prof. [Florin Manea](https://flmanea.blogspot.com/)'s group at the Universty of Göttingen and Prof. [Dirk Beyer](https://www.sosy-lab.org/)'s group at LMU Munich.

My strongest research interest is to combine reasoning and learning. Below are some of my current and past research projects: 

- Algorithm Selection and Strategy Synthesis for SMT
- [Algorithm Selection for Verification](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/FGmF8gS3)
- [String Constraint Solving](https://z3string.github.io/)
- Machine Learning for SAT heuristics

======
- *Nov 2024* Together with collarabtors from Geogia Tech and UBC, I'm organizing an **AAAI'25 tutorial** [ML for Solvers](https://ml-for-solvers.github.io/)! More info will be posted on our [website](https://ml-for-solvers.github.io/). Hope to see you in Philadelphia!
- *Nov 2024* From May to November, I successfully completed a [**Google Summer of Code project**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/FGmF8gS3)! Many thanks to my GSoC mentors [Po-Chun Chien](https://www.sosy-lab.org/people/chien/) and Dr. [Nian-Ze Lee](https://nianzelee.github.io/) from LMU Munich. During this project, we developed the first [ML-based algorithm selector for the Btor2 hardware verificaiton prroblem](https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/btor2-select). I will be presenting some early results at the **AAAI'25 Student Program**.
- *Sep 2024* I start serving as the [ECE-GSA](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering-graduate-student-association/) Co-Chair of the upcoming year. I’m excited to contribute to the community and help foster a supportive and inclusive environment for fellow graduate students. Let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions for initiatives or events you’d like to see this year!
- *Aug 2024* Our paper *[Layered and Staged Monte Carlo Tree Search for SMT Strategy Synthesis](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/0211.pdf)* is presented at **IJCAI 2024**! Unfortunately, I couldn't travel to Jeju Island due to a broken ankle, but I'm super grateful to Prof. [Kate Larson](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~klarson/index.html) for help us present this research! This research was partly developed during Kate's CS685 class as a course project, and her feedback along the way was incredibly helpful. Thank you so much, Kate!
- *Jul 2024* At **SMT 2024**, I made my first [paper presentation](https://easychair.org/smart-slide/slide/p8zq#) (with crutches)! 
- *Jul 2024* Our solver [Z3-alpha](https://github.com/JohnLyu2/z3alpha) won [multiple awards](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dEeJFfzjJz4vp-mU5XiGnR-hHJdsU1QZ/view?usp=sharing) at **SMT-COMP 2024**! It excelled across divisions such as QF_Datatypes, QF_LinearIntArith, QF_NonLinearIntArith, and QF_NonLinearRealArith! Read more on [Georgia Tech News](https://research.gatech.edu/award-winning-software-tool-uses-innovative-approach). 
- *Jun 2024* Happy to receive the Winter 2024 FOE Graduate Scholarship! Some more bucks to enjoy a decent dinner : )
- *May 2024* Attended the inaugural [AI-SCORE Summer School](https://ai-score.github.io/) and had so much fun!
- *Sep 2023* Start working as the Website Chair for [CAV 2024](https://i-cav.org/2024/).
- *Jul 2023* Offcially start my PhD journey at UWaterloo! Thanks for the generous funding from the [Engineering Excellence Doctoral Fellowship (EEDF)](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/awards/engineering-excellence-masters-and-doctoral-fellowships-eemf) and the Deans Entrance Award.
