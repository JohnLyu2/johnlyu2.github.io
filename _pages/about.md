Hi, this is John Lü 吕正旸. Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a 2nd-year PhD student at UWaterloo, under the supervision of 
[Vijay Ganesh](https://vganesh1.github.io/) and [Arie Gurfinkel](https://arieg.bitbucket.io/). 

<!-- I am also collarbating with [Florin Manea](https://flmanea.blogspot.com/)'s group at the Universty of Göttingen 
and [Dirk Beyer](https://www.sosy-lab.org/)'s group at LMU Munich.  -->

My research interest is to desgin learning-based algorithms that circumvent the worst-case complexity 
of NP-hard problems by focusing on application-specific instances.

<!-- - Algorithm Selection and [Strategy Synthesis](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/0211.pdf) for SMT
- [Algorithm Selection for Verification](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/FGmF8gS3)
- Machine Learning for SAT heuristics -->

- *[Feb 2025]*  I co-organized and presented the AAAI’25 tutorial [ML for Solvers](https://ml-for-solvers.github.io/)! In the tutorial, we introduced the latest advancements of how various machine learning techniques are used in logic solvers. Slides and materials are available on our [website](https://ml-for-solvers.github.io/). Thanks to everyone who attended and contributed to the discussion!
- *[Nov 2024]*  From May to November, I successfully completed a [**Google Summer of Code project**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/FGmF8gS3)! Many thanks to my GSoC mentors [Po-Chun Chien](https://www.sosy-lab.org/people/chien/) and Dr. [Nian-Ze Lee](https://nianzelee.github.io/) from LMU Munich. During this project, we developed the first [ML-based algorithm selector](https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/btor2-select) for the Btor2 hardware verificaiton prroblem. I will be presenting some early results at the **AAAI'25 Student Program**.
- *[Sep 2024]*  I start serving as the [ECE-GSA](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering-graduate-student-association/) Co-Chair for the upcoming year. I’m excited to contribute to the community and help foster a supportive and inclusive environment for fellow graduate students. Let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions for initiatives or events you’d like to see this year!
- *[Aug 2024]*  Our paper *[Layered and Staged Monte Carlo Tree Search for SMT Strategy Synthesis](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/0211.pdf)* is presented at **IJCAI 2024**! Unfortunately, I couldn't travel to Jeju Island due to a broken ankle, but I'm super grateful to Prof. [Kate Larson](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~klarson/index.html) for help us present this research! 
- *[Jul 2024]*  At **SMT 2024**, I made my first [paper presentation](https://easychair.org/smart-slide/slide/p8zq#) (with crutches)! 
- *[Jul 2024]*  Our solver [Z3-alpha](https://github.com/JohnLyu2/z3alpha) won [multiple awards](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dEeJFfzjJz4vp-mU5XiGnR-hHJdsU1QZ/view?usp=sharing) at **SMT-COMP 2024**! It excelled across divisions such as QF_Datatypes, QF_LinearIntArith, QF_NonLinearIntArith, and QF_NonLinearRealArith!

- *[Jun 2024]*  Happy to receive the Winter 2024 FOE Graduate Scholarship! Some more bucks to enjoy a decent dinner : )
- *[May 2024]*  Attended the inaugural [AI-SCORE Summer School](https://ai-score.github.io/) and had so much fun!
- *[Sep 2023]*  Start working as the Website Chair for [CAV 2024](https://i-cav.org/2024/).
- *[Jul 2023]*  Offcially start my PhD journey at UWaterloo! Thanks for the generous funding from the [Engineering Excellence Doctoral Fellowship (EEDF)](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/awards/engineering-excellence-masters-and-doctoral-fellowships-eemf) and the Deans Entrance Award.
